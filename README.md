* **Team Management:**
    * Assign team members to projects and manage their roles and permissions.

* **Project Milestones:**
    * Define and track project milestones.

* **Risk Management:**
    * Identify and track potential project risks.

## 3. Category Management

* **Create and Manage Categories:**
    * Create custom categories to organize tasks within projects.
    * Assign colors to categories for easy visual identification.

## 4. User Management

* **User Profiles:**
